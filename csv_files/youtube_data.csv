Sometimes we want to use our code, the logic of the code multiple times. Suppose we want to print from 1 to 15 in our program 15 times. And suppose the code to do this work is of 10 lines. So we don't want to repeat these 10 lines in our program. There are two reasons for this. If we repeat these lines, then suppose I want to change the code in these lines, then I will have to repeat it in those 15 places where this program is being used. I will have to repeat these lines wherever they are being used.","['Educational', 'programming', 'python', 'tutorials']"
